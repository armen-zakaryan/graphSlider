## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the above mentioned repository and install the dependencies running npm start:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the angular-seed repository. You can get it from
[http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

We also use a number of node.js tools to initialize and test angular-seed. You must have node.js and
its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

### Install Dependencies

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].
We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```
* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
